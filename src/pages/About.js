      <h1>About us</h1>
      <p>
        This page has been tailored by 4 engineering students from Oulu
        University of Applied Sciences, for the purpose of practicing our
        fundamentals in web-development. This project is a testament of our
        knowledge and skills we have acquired during our second year of studies.
        Before this project, we had the knowledge of the courses we had in our
        first year. This year we had courses on Web Development Frameworks,
        Cloud Services and Java Programming.
      </p>

        We approached this project with the goal of creating an user friendly,
        simple and flexible website. We plan that this could be a platform for
        designing and implementing of a data visualization for visualising
        climate change data, such as temperature and CO2. We really excited to
        be working with this project and wish to recieve any feedback.
