## info about frontend
Welcome!
This is the frontend of our Advanced Web Application, it was made as a project at OAMK.


The front end can be installed relatively easy: 
1. Clone this repository
2. Run 'npm i' in frontend directory, this command [will install required libraries](https://manpages.org/npm-install) 
3. Run 'npm start'. This command [will start the front end](https://man.archlinux.org/man/npm-start.1)

If you didn't do it before, you may want to start backend server.
